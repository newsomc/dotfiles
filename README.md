dotfiles
========

My dotfiles for easy access.

Installation
------------
**Installation will delete previous dotfiles in your home folder**

Run the following commands:

    git clone git@github.com:santialbo/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    make clean && make

Once installed you will need to run `:BundleInstall` in order to get all the plugins from their own repositories.
